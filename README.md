Personal data relating to breastfeeding of my infant son
The subject was born on Febuary 9th. All breastfeeding times were logged on the app Nursing (© Claudia and Matthias Droste), 
since the subject’s mother had nothing better to do on her phone. Raw data was exported and analysed in R. Bottle feeding 
times were not logged, but derived from the consumed amount of milk under the assumed feeding speed of 10 ml/min (10 min 
for a 100 ml bottle). This will lead to an underestimation of bottle feeding times at a young age and an overestimation at 
a later age, as the speed of feeding usually increases with age. Bottle feeding consisted of mostly (~80%) formula and the 
remaining part pumped milk. Separate feedings were defined as feedings with at least 30 minutes of non-feeding time in between.
